1) Is there a difference in bleaching scores depending on water depth (i.e., 6 m vs. 12 m sampled corals)? 
--Investigates the general notion of a difference in bleaching depending on water depth alone.--
SELECT DISTINCT --select only distinct values as we only need the average for two depths and not all entries.--
	[Depth (m)],
	ROUND(AVG([Bleaching Score]) OVER (PARTITION BY [Depth (m)]),1) AS [AVG_Bleaching_Score] --add round() function to round the output to one decimal place.--
FROM [SQL_Project].[dbo].['All Data$']
ORDER BY [Depth (m)] ASC;


OUTPUT:
Depth (m)	AVG_Bleaching_Score
6	2.1
12	2.4

There is only a marginal difference between the average bleaching scores at 6 and 12 meters water depth. The averaging function does not account for Year, Site, Morphotaxa. To investigate a possible difference between Genus and Form (i.e., Morphotaxa), an adjustment is in order.




2) Is there a difference between genera or rather [Morphotaxa]?
--Site, Year, (Genus, Form) Morphotaxa might make a difference that can be accounted for by adjusting the arguments within the 'partition by' clause. As the output would be 633 rows, I reduced the output to the top 20 worst performers.--
SELECT DISTINCT TOP 20 --select only for the top 20 entries, ordered by the average bleaching score based on following parameters in descending order.--
	[Year],	
	[Site],
	[Depth (m)],
	[Morphotaxa],
	ROUND(AVG([Bleaching Score]) OVER (PARTITION BY [Depth (m)], [Year], [Site], [Morphotaxa]), 1) AS [AVG_Bleaching_Score] --add round() function to round the output to one decimal place, as more do not add any further value to the bleaching score.--
FROM [SQL_Project].[dbo].['All Data$']
ORDER BY [AVG_Bleaching_Score] DESC;

But what are the most and least susceptible genera? The tables above include not only the site and depth but also the form, which makes it harder to read, when only interested in the performance of each [Genus] per year.

This table suggests that there might be differences, within and across genus, between Year 2019 and 2020. 




3)Is there a difference between Year 2019 and Year 2020? If so, which [Morphotaxa] displayed the highest difference between the back-to-back bleaching events? Here, a negative value represents a decline in coral health from Year 2019 to 2020.

--The data from 2019 (1882 rows) and 2020 (1873 rows) IS NOT same sized. As I want to compare the same genus / morphotaxa entry across year, a continuous ID within Morphotaxa can help, using the row_number() function within a CTE for each year.--
